## <span style="color:green">about</span> <span style="color:#640433">us</span>

We are a retail services development team from a company in the Philippines. In our quest to continously develop and learn, we conduct our own researches and build projects outside our regular working hours. 

Most of the members are active employees, but since this is GitHub, any contributor is welcome.

The GitHub community is welcome to contribute. We have a group of core maintainers to review and consider your pull requests.

### guidelines to contributors

#### issuing a pull request
1. Fork the repository you are interested in.
2. Create a new branch on the forked repo that will contain your proposed changes. It is recommended that each changes or fix should reside on its own branch.
3. Make sure your changes are fully tested.
4. If there is an existing open issue listed on the project please use the issue number to reference you pull request.
5. If this is a feature or a fix not listed, please submit an issue on the main repo.
6. Submit a pull request. Make sure you include the issue number.
7. Our group of core contributors will review your pull request.

#### issuing a request to fork an existing repo
This is limited to active employees only. When a project is currently hosted in the contrbutors repo and needs to be added to the RSearch Labs repo, the contributors needs to send an email to the core group.
