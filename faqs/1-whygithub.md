# Why <span style="color:#D4AC0D">Git</span><span style="color:green">Hub</span> ?

Simple, because its THE GitHub! It is the universal repository for most open source project. Not just any open source project, projects from the big tech such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Mozilla and the likes are all over GitHub. Microsoft abandoned its Codeplex service and acquired GitHub. Its a haven for programmers  and collaborators. Its the Facebook for codes!

## What can <span style="color:green">we</span> <span style="color:#FFC300">do</span> in GitHub?

Primarily, GitHub is an online repository of codes. But thats the old GitHub, it has grown over the years adding services and integrating to allot of third party tools in the market. From analytics, error reporting, project managment, continuous integration, continuous delivery, devops operation and to vast list of geek magics. Its a virtual swiss knife for an individual ninja, a promising startup or a gigantic enterprise .

The online repository opens to a lot off possibilities. It provides a gateway to interface to a lot of online services. The dark ages of keeping your source code in a drive is gone so is the concept of keeping the code for your self. As long as it does not violate laws, company policies and doesn't expose private details, going open source is a way to grow and improve your idea. GitHub provide that avenue, supporting both private at public repositories.

GitHub is just not about codes! You can host a blog, a document, a tutorial, a static web page , a gist (code snippets) for free!

Repository. Collaboration. Integration. GitHub.
