Everyone, especially the active employees. The [primer page](https://rsx-labs.github.io/rsx-labs-primer/) list down the guidelines for developers to contribute. If you are new to the platform, worry not. This page is for you.

## New to GitHub

You probably heard of the name in some news or in stackoverflow, but you don't know where to start. All you need to join the rest of the open source warriors in GitHub is a valid email. A personal email is recommended so you have complete control of the account even if you moved out of your company. Please visit GitHub's link below on how to signup.

## Join RSExperimetal Labs 

The title sounds all inclusive but unfortunately it is not. Membership is by invitation. All active employees are encouraged to join and be part of the group. First you need to signup to GitHub (see above). To join, simply email us your GitHub account through the company email and we will send you the invite. Its as easier that printing 'Hello World' on the console.

Everyone can view, fork, and issue a pull request but members are first class contributors. You will be granted additional rights as well as access to private repos.

## Contribute and engage

There are many ways to contribute on a project. You may not be savy enough to understand the code but you know how it work and is willing to improve it. Three steps : fork, modify, and issue a pull request.

A detailed guideline on how to contrbite is on the [primer page](https://rsx-labs.github.io/rsx-labs-primer/).
